# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset using LSTM

This project is a sentiment analysis tool built on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The objective is to classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an LSTM layer.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- LSTM-based RNN model for sentiment analysis
- Model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics
- Function to predict the sentiment of a new review

## Dataset
- The dataset is sourced from the IMDB website and contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews.

## Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `nltk`
- `tensorflow`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Usage
